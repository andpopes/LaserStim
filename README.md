# LaserStim

These Matlab (32-bit) functions are provided for generating a two-laser stimulation protocol, as described in Levitz, et al., Frontiers in Molecular Neuroscience. The software controls a National Instruments DAQ-PCI board through Matlab's Data Acquisition Toolbox:

* MAG_Run.m is the starting point for generating and running the experimental protocol. Read the comments inside the file for a detailed description and examples.
* NI.m contains the code for controlling the NI board
